# Trace RSA Cryptography
 Simple program written for a homework assignment that shows the process of an RSA encryption and decryption. The Fast Modular Exponentiation method is used to get a better big O time and to help deal with the huge numbers RSA can create.
 
 The values used at the top are just the values that were used for the assignment. These can be changed to any (reasonable) number.
